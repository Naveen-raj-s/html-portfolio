<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm Naveen Raj S. I'm 25 years old and from Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu.
  I completed my B.Sc. in Geology in 2021.
  During my studies, I had the opportunity to lead a team of five members in a four-day mapping fieldwork project,
  which enhanced my leadership and teamwork skills.
  Recently, I finished a frontend developer course in 2023 at Mashupstack Institute to improve my technical skills.
</p>

<p>I have strong communication skills, which help me connect with people and work effectively in a team.
   I enjoy working with technology and solving problems in creative ways.
   I'm looking for opportunities to join a team where I can use my skills, communicate effectively, and keep learning new things.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love playing cricket and other games, which help me stay active and build teamwork skills.</p>
